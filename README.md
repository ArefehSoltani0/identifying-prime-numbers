# Identifying Prime Numbers 🧮

A simple C# project for checking whether a given number is prime.  
This project is designed for beginners who want to practice basic programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and algorithmic thinking.

---

## 📌 Overview
This program receives a number from the user and determines whether it is a prime number.  
It can be used for learning, practicing, or as a base for more advanced numerical or mathematical applications.

---

## ✨ Features
- Checks if a number is prime
- Simple and clean code structure
- User-friendly Windows Forms interface (or console logic, depending on how you extend it)
- Easy to understand and modify

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ArefehSoltani0/identifying-prime-numbers.git
2. Open the project

Open the .sln file using Visual Studio or any IDE that supports C# and .NET.

3. Build & Run
After opening the project, simply build and run it.
Enter a number in the provided interface and the program will tell you whether it is prime
🧠 How Prime Checking Works

The program uses a basic algorithm:

A prime number is a number greater than 1

It is divisible only by 1 and itself

The algorithm checks divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number


This approach is efficient and commonly used in introductory programming and algorithm courses.
